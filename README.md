# microsoft/security-devops-action (Preview)

Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) is a command line application which integrates static analysis tools into the development cycle. MSDO installs, configures and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools (including, but not limited to, SDL/security and compliance tools). MSDO is data-driven with portable configurations that enable deterministic execution across multiple environments. For tools that output results in or MSDO can convert their results to SARIF, MSDO imports into a normalized file database for seamlessly reporting and responding to results across tools, such as forcing build breaks.

Run locally. Run remotely.

This action runs the [Microsoft Security DevOps CLI](https://aka.ms/msdo-nuget) for security analysis:

* Installs the Microsoft Security DevOps CLI
* Installs the latest Microsoft security policy
* Installs the latest Microsoft and 3rd party security tools
* Automatic or user-provided configuration of security tools
* Execution of a full suite of security tools
* Normalized processing of results into the SARIF format
* Build breaks and more

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic

Run **Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO)** with the default policy and recommended tools.

```yaml
permissions:
  security-events: write

steps:

- uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps
  uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@latest
  id: msdo
```

## Upload Results to the Security tab

To upload results to the Security tab of your repo, run the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action immediately after running MSDO. MSDO sets the action output variable `sarifFile` to the path of a single SARIF file that can be uploaded to this API.

```yaml
- name: Upload results to Security tab
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: ${{ steps.msdo.outputs.sarifFile }}
```

## Advanced

To only run specific analyzers, use the `tools` command. This command is a comma-seperated list of tools to run. For example, to run only the `container-mapping` tool, configure this action as follows:

```yaml
- uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@latest
  id: msdo
  with:
    tools: container-mapping
```
